Project Reflection README
In this project, I had the opportunity to reflect on my work and to think about the larger field of computer science. Below, I will answer some questions to help add context to refresh my memory when I use my portfolio in the future.

Brief explanation of the work
In this project, I was given starter code, which you see in the attached files, then I created different scenarios by manipul;ating the varibles in the code. The end goal was for the pirate to find the treaser at the end of the maze.

Connecting learning to computer science
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and develop new computer technologies, including hardware and software systems. They also research and explore new areas of computing and work on solutions to complex problems. Computer science matters because it enables innovation, advances research, and drives the development of new technologies.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems in a structured and logical manner. I first analyze the problem to understand the requirements and constraints, and then I break it down into smaller parts to create a plan of action. I use programming languages and other tools to develop a solution and test it for correctness and efficiency.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization. I must ensure that the software and systems I develop are safe, reliable, and secure. I must also respect the privacy and rights of the end user and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Additionally, I must consider the potential impact of my work on society and strive to make ethical decisions that benefit the greater good.

Conclusion
Reflecting on my work in these projects was a valuable exercise that helped me to cement my learning and to think more broadly about computer science. By connecting my learning to the larger field, I gained a deeper appreciation for the impact that computer science can have on society, and I became more aware of my ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist.
